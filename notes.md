College Application Checklist

Simple checklist of tasks for college-bound users 

Users can add all colleges they are applying to:
  - Check off tasks such as submit application, pay application fee
  - Add college visit date

Other tasks added: (but checkboxes are not working independently!!!)
  - request transcripts from all schools, pay that fee
  - request recommendation letters
  - send test scores ACT/SAT/GRE/GMAT, pay that fee


Notes section:
  - users can add notes
  - users can view and delete notes

Notes will have a title, content, user_id


College Visit: 
- If user has entered a college visit date, would like that date to display in the date field on the edit page

- create alert: if user sets two or more college visit on same day, "you alrady have a college visit scheduled on this day, are you sure?"

Other functions that would be nice:
 - set up alerts
 - add deadline (default December 1st)
 - ex. -you have 15 days before deadline
 - ex. -Don't forget to ask teachers for recommendation letter or pay fee, etc.
